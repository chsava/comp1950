<p><a href="answers/">Answers to student questionnaires</a></p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>The COMP 1950 owner (Alistair Calder) would like the web site redesigned in order to better meet the needs of students. The website owner has contracted your group, as students of the class, to act as contractors for this project.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students must have easy access to notes, examples and other information</li>
  <li>The site should reflect the aims of the course: Standards compliant web development, CSS, HTML, Methodology-driven design, etc</li>
  <li>Think outside the box - don’t just copy the current design. Look around at other sites and use your creativity. But - be realistic! Make your suggestions something that can work</li>
  <li>If you have questions that will further refine your own direction, ask the owner of the site for details
Think about this project in context of the Methodology discussion that happened in class and the readings for week 8</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

<p>For this project, you have been contracted to provide a protosite and supporting documents for the proposed website
Your deliverables are going to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A web site created for this project that describes the project (similar to this <a href="http://thenet.ca/project/deliverables.html">example sitemap</a>) and links to various artifacts. This is generally known as a meta site.</li>
  <li>An Introduction page that describes the project and the members of the team. This page should also list what each team member actually did during the project</li>
  <li>A proto-site that has at least three of the main pages mocked up. The home page, a lecture page and a blog page are required, others as necessary.</li>
  <li>The blog page can either be news, or a blog or whatever you think would make for timely news.  <strong>You must use Tumblr for this</strong>, and make your template match whatever you come up with for the rest of the site.</li>
  <li>Wireframe(s) of the major sections of the site (<a href="http://thenet.ca/project/wireframe.html">Example lecture page</a>) that you used to design the protosite (done in HTML, Word or Visio). These can also be done by using paper prototypes (scanned) or just using a low-tech solution like Word (make boxes in Drawing mode) or HTML (using simple tables)</li>
  <li>Include descriptions of what is included in each content area</li>
  <li>Sitemap (<a href="http://thenet.ca/project/sitemap.html">Example sitemap</a>) (HTML, Word or Visio)</li>
  <li>Rationale page - this is the most important page in your site. This is where you describe why you chose to build the site in the way you have proposed. Make sure you agreee on this in your group!</li>
  <li>All of this should be presented in an HTML compliant web site with CSS-based Navigation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>

<p>This project will require work from all members of your team!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start by agreeing on a plan of attack - get agreement!</li>
  <li>Start making decisions on how the site will look, what functions it needs to have, how users will access information</li>
  <li>Draw some sketches for how it could look, think about labels and information design</li>
  <li>Once you know what needs to be on the site and how it will look, divide up the work. Make sure your team knows who is doing what</li>
  <li>There is plenty to do, but if you work together, it is an easy project to get done in time</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All content must be valid HTML5</li>
  <li>All presentation must be valid CSS</li>
  <li>Add a referer link on each page to validate: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="remember">Remember!</h3>

<p>This project can be done with approximately 8 - 10 hours of total work. With 4 people on a team, and 4 hours of (total) class time available, that equals 16 hours. More than enough time.</p>

<p>Look at the existing site, but don’t necessarily base your new site on that one. Think outside the box! Be creative!
As a student, YOU are the audience. Talk to your cohorts, spend time considering the current experience, design the site the way you think it would work best.</p>

<p>You do not have to include actual notes for the class. This project is to produce a proof-of-concept of the new COMP 1950 site</p>

<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>

<p>Once complete, send the URL for your project site to: <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#097;&#099;&#097;&#108;&#100;&#101;&#114;&#049;&#064;&#109;&#121;&#046;&#098;&#099;&#105;&#116;&#046;&#099;&#097;">&#097;&#099;&#097;&#108;&#100;&#101;&#114;&#049;&#064;&#109;&#121;&#046;&#098;&#099;&#105;&#116;&#046;&#099;&#097;</a></p>
