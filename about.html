  <dt>CSS</dt>

  <dt>FTP</dt>
  <dd>You should know how to log into an FTP server and upload/download files. If you don’t know how to do this at all, you will need to learn this immediately.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="my-expectation">My expectation</h2>

<p>I am the instructor for 1950 and, as such, I get to set the rules. Think of me like your boss. Here are the rules I have for this course</p>

<dl>
  <dt>File/Folder Names</dt>
  <dd>While it is technically possible, I do not want any capital letters or spaces in your file or folder names. Special Characters (those characters over the numbers on your keyboard) just won’t work.</dd>
  <dt>Student Pages</dt>
  <dd>The student pages are located at: students.thenet.ca/(student_name) Notice that there is no www at the front. More detail on student pages.</dd>
  <dt>Course web site</dt>
  <dd>You will set up a course web site for COMP 1950 and will maintain it each week. Homework, in-class assignments and any exercises should be on your course web site. In order to get any feedback, your assignments must be completed on time. Otherwise I simply do not have the time to mark late homewok.</dd>
  <dt>Navigation</dt>
  <dd>Please try to make things as easy to find as possible</dd>
  <dt>A simple reminder</dt>
  <dd>This course is about Web Development. This means you should conduct yourself as Web Developers! Think about what you are creating and how it would/could/should be viewed by others.</dd>
