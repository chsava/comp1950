<h2 id="book-for-the-course">Book for the course</h2>

<p>I don’t have a book for this course, because there is just too much to teach at an intermediate level.  I have yet to find a book adequate.</p>

<p>However, certain subjects have excellent books and I’ll mention them during the lecture.  You are not required to buy them, but are encouraged to take a look if interested.</p>

<h2 id="marking">Marking</h2>

<p>I don’t mark individual homework assignments.  I mark them as a whole at the end of the course.  </p>

<p>Instead, I give feedback on each assignment so you know how you are doing.  </p>

<p>Quizzes, Midterms, the Project and Final are all marked and I will share those marks with you the week after.</p>

<h2 id="other-subjects-tailor-the-course">Other subjects? Tailor the course!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What would you like to learn about?</li>
  <li>What are you most interested in learning?</li>
  <li>What skills would you like to acquire?</li>
  <li>Are there subjects not covered here?</li>
  <li>Brief introduction to myBCIT and a course survey</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="take-survey-now">Take survey now</h2>
<p>I’ll give you instructions on how to get there, don’t worry.</p>

<h2 id="introductions">Introductions</h2>

<p>First we’ll start with me, then we’ll go around the room.  Don’t worry, you won’t have to actually introduce <em>yourself</em>.</p>

<h3 id="about-alistair">About Alistair</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Web Developer since 1995</li>
  <li>Lead web developer for:
    <ul>
      <li>Top Producer Systems</li>
      <li>Multiactive</li>
      <li>One Atmosphere (my own development firm)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Currently: Technical lead on student portal, myBCIT</li>
  <li>Broad knowledge set focussed mainly on web technologies</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="little-know-trivia">Little know trivia</h3>

<p>Snuck into the construction site of the Rogers Cantel building, took the elevator up and locked myself out on the roof by accident. Had to call a friend, convince him of my story, then further convince him to sneak past the guard, and break me back into the building.  </p>

<h2 id="your-turn">Your turn</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Current occupation</li>
  <li>Web development experience</li>
  <li>Little-known trivia</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep it pretty short, but to the point.  The important part is <strong>I want to know who you are and why you are here</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="student-pages">Student Pages</h2>
<p>Each student will get web space. This may be different than in the past, as this space is exclusively yours, with your own username and password.</p>

<p>This is also <strong>not</strong> a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one). This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments, group work and more. Make it a site that is usable and functional.</p>

<p>I will be calling each of you up so you can enter a password - this can be anything you like but <em>please make it secure</em>.  We live in a time when secure passwords are an absolute necessity.</p>

<p><a href="/studentpages">More information on student pages</a>.</p>

<h2 id="course-web-site">Course web site</h2>

<p>Your course web site should be a location that your client (who is also your instructor) can easily acccess information about you or your homework.</p>

<p>Check out the example page created by a past student: <a href="http://past.thenet.ca/lori/">Lori’s Example</a></p>

<h3 id="required-items">Required items</h3>

<ul>
  <li>On your homepage:
    <ul>
      <li>some basic information about yourself (such as from your introduction today)</li>
      <li>include a photo (so I know who is who)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For week one, please be sure these elements are added somewhere:
    <ul>
      <li>A brief overview of your web development skill level</li>
      <li>Description of web development work you have done so far (links to examples or screenshots)</li>
      <li>Links to favourite sites, either because of esthetic, technology, etc</li>
      <li>A list of applications, tools, browser plug-ins or IDEs that you use for web development. Include a link to each of these tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use your understanding of HTML and CSS to the limit of your knowledge, but ensure that it is usable, presentable and coherent</p>

<h3 id="please-note">Please note!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Link to exercises and assignments by the appropriate week. Don’t make me have to search for your homework.</li>
  <li>No Javascript <strong>at all</strong> (this will change after Week 1)</li>
  <li>There needs to be a link from the myBCIT Members page to your Student Homepage</li>
</ul>
