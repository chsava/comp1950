<h1 class="page-title">Week Two Homework</h1>
  <h2 id="create-two-realtor-pages">Create Two Realtor Pages</h2>

<p>You will create the same page, but twice: One in <strong>XHTML Strict</strong> and the other using <strong>HTML5</strong></p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>You will create a web page for a Realtor (fictional or real), which we will use as the course goes on. </p>

<h3 id="required-components">Required components</h3>

<p>Take a look at existing Realtor sites and take a look at some of the standard elements in each. </p>

<p>At a minimum, each version (XHTML and HTML5) should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Realtor photo</li>
  <li>Company information (Company name, Logo)</li>
  <li>Contact information (phone, email, address)</li>
  <li>Where in the lower mainland they work</li>
  <li>At least 2 current listings</li>
  <li>At least 2 sold listings</li>
  <li>Short Realtor biography</li>
</ul>

<p>The page does not have to be big, think of it as a summary page. We will build listings and more detail later.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The focus of your page should be the inclusion of information rather than the presentation.  </li>
  <li>Use CSS to create the presentation layer, fonts and measurements donâ€™t have to be exact.</li>
  <li>Use any layout scheme you would like (tables, CSS, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="versions">Versions</h3>

<p>There will be two versions of the page you create.  They should both contain the same information but built with two different web technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>XHTML Strict</strong> - Be sure to review the requirements for an XHTML Strict page</li>
  <li><strong>HTML5</strong> -  Review what we discussed to day about HTML5 and be sure to include tags from HTML5</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="validate">Validate!</h3>

<p>Each of your pages <strong>must validate</strong> as either XHTML Strict or HTML5. Use the <a href="http://validator.w3.org">W3C Validator</a> to check them.</p>
