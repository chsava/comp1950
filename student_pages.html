<h1 class="page-title">Student Pages</h1>
  <p>All your homework <em>must</em> reside within the student pages provided for this course.  This is so the instructor can track your progress and examine any code that may be server-processed.</p>

<h2 id="ftp-client">FTP Client</h2>

<p>You can use any FTP program you are comfortable with. There is most likely one installed in the labs (it changes from term to term) but you can download and install any one you want.</p>

<p>Filezilla is a great FTP client that works on Mac/PC/Linux if you are looking for one to install on your laptop or at home.</p>

<p>If you arenâ€™t knowledgeable with any FTP programs yet, just let me know!</p>

<h2 id="account-details">Account details</h2>

<p>An account is created for each student that gives them 200MB of space, and a URL they can navigate to.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-find-your-url">How to find your URL</h3>

<p>Your student page will always be at:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">http://students.thenet.ca/{student-account}</code></pre></div>

<p>The {student-account} part is almost always your <em>first initial</em> and <em>last name</em>.  For instance, <em>John Smith</em> would end up as <em>jsmith</em></p>

<h3 id="how-to-ftp-to-your-account">How to FTP to your account</h3>

<p>In order to log into your FTP account, you will need:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Hostname: thenet.ca
	Username: {student-account}@thenet.ca
	Password: {whatever you create}</code></pre></div>

<p>Please take note that your username <em>must</em> end in <strong>@thenet.ca</strong> for it to work.</p>
