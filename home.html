        HTML5 is now a recommendation
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>You might not realize this, but HTML5 has been a RFC (or “Request for Comment”) for the last 5 years, which means that it wasn’t an official specification.  The recent move to Recommendation status means that HTML5 is now an <em>official</em> specification.</p>

    <h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>
  
    <p>Basically it means that you can now use it in any application and expect that the rules set out in the spec can (and should be) followed by developers and manufacturers.</p>

    <p>It’s September 2014, HTML5, CSS3 and JS are generally well accepted, Microsoft has made a half decent browser and front-end web development is a solid job on it’s own!</p>

    <p>In COMP 1950, we’re going to take a look at that front end stack, how it works and how you can build pages with those three technologies.</p>
    
    <p>During the first half of the course, we will take a hard look at HTML and CSS and where we are now as web developers.  We will move on to Template development (the primary task in web development these days) and sprinkle on some JS later on.</p>
    
    <p>This page will contain news or updates from time to time, so stay tuned!</p>
